Create a Cloudformation template based on the below request.
Create a Custom VPC	with CIDR ranges "10.0.0.0/16". Name this VPC as "CustomVPC".
Create 2 Subnets. Subnet 1 with CIDR "10.0.1.0/24" called "PublicSn". Subnet 2 with CIDR "10.0.2.0/24" called "PrivateSn".
Create 1 Internet Gateway and attach to the CustomVPC.
Create 2 Routetables. One Route table called "Public-RT" allowing communication on port 80 and port 22 from and to outside world, meaning allowing incoming connections
from 0.0.0.0/0. Explicitly assign the PublicSn to this Route table. Next create the Second route table called "Private-RT" allowing internal communications only
within the VPC. Explicitly assign the "PrivateSn" to this Route Table
Do not make any changes on the newly created NACL, but ensure all traffic is allowed on both inbound and outbound traffic.
Create 2 Security groups. create 1 SG for allowing incoming connections from outside world, meaning 0.0.0.0/0 assign to public RT.
Create 1 SG for allowing incoming connections from public subnet to private subnet.
Also create a rule within the route table to allow communications from a application load balancer to the instance within the private subnet.
Create a NAT gateway, place it in the PublicSn. 
Now create one instance in the "PublicSn" subnet using AMI ID: ami-00c257e12d6828491, name it as "jumpServer"
and allow communications from 0.0.0.0/0 on port 22 only.
Now create one instance in the "PrivateSn" subnet using AMI ID: ami-00c257e12d6828491 and name it as "webServer". This webserver must be able to access the outside world
for downloads and updates using the NAT gateway. Install Apache webserver(apache2) on the "webServer" instance, which is an Ubuntu based AMI.
Create a application load balancer and route user traffic to the webserver running on the private server via the Application load balancer only.
